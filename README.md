# TrainReservationSystem
Here, we address the significant challenge of deadlocks in the Railway Booking System, where conflicting resource requests can disrupt efficient travel planning and affect the passenger experience. We aim to highlight the gravity of this issue and its implications, including delays and customer dissatisfaction. Our objective is to introduce the Banker's Algorithm as a practical solution to resolve these challenges and enhance the reliability of railway operations.

The objective of the railway booking project, within the context of operating systems, is to devise a reservation system that not only facilitates streamlined ticket booking and availability checks but also integrates a robust deadlock solution. The primary focus revolves around the identification and resolution of potential deadlock scenarios within the system, employing effective concurrency management strategies. The project seeks to implement mechanisms for preventing and resolving deadlocks, ensuring uninterrupted operation and responsiveness,
especially during periods of high demand. Furthermore, the system architecture will be designed to manage concurrent access effectively, mitigating the risk of data inconsistencies and conflicts. The emphasis on optimizing performance aligns with considerations at the operating system level, guaranteeing scalability, security, and adherence to regulatory standards. Continuous monitoring, user feedback channels, and iterative improvement processes will be implemented to enhance the system's deadlock management and overall efficiency
within the operating system framework.
